# OCDS Implementation and Extensions

The [Open Contracting Data Standard](http://standard.open-contracting.org) is designed to allow publication of comprehensive information on contracting processes.

## Implementation support
Publishing using OCDS often involve decisions about how to map from your existing data to the Open Contracting Data Standard. You can [use the issue tracker](issues) to share your questions about data modelling and mapping for open discussion.

The OCDS Helpdesk monitor and respond to these issues - but they are also open to wider community input (which is encouraged!). 

## Extensions
OCDS has an extension mechanism. 

If you need to share information for which no existing OCDS fields exist, [you can propose **extensions** to the standard](http://ocds.open-contracting.org/standard/r/1__0__RC/en/key_concepts/conformance_and_extensions/#extensions).

You can propose extensions in the issue tracker. 

If you are comfortable working with JSON Schema, you can also submit a pull request against this repository to add a proposed extension.
