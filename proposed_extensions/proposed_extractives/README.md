# Extractives Extensions

Publicly traded oil, gas and mining companies have an estimated market capitalisation of â‚¬6.1tn, with extractives contracts responsible for a sizeable proportion of GDP in many countries. Every year energy product imports around the world top $3tn. 

The core Open Contracting Data Standard was developed to represent contracting processes in procurement, but with extractives-relevant extensions, it can also be of great value in standardising contracts disclosures and supporting the consistent exchange of information about extractives contracts.
